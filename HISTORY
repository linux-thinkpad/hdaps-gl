This program began as an OpenGL tutorial written by Jeff Molofee
(support@nehe.me) on the site gamedev.net in 1999:

  https://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/lessons_01__05/22004/

That tutorial was ported to Linux/GLUT by Richard Campbell
(ulmont@bellsouth.net), also in 1999. This example code formed the
basis of hdaps-gl which, at the time, just displayed a simple OpenGL
window with a cube in it.

To make the OpenGL window "do something," the tutorial code was
combined with Jesper Juhl's (jesperjuhl76@gmail.com)
ibm_hdaps_userspace.c to allow it to determine the laptop's
orientation and rotate the cube accordingly. The timing of this is
lost to eternity, or is perhaps buried in the hdaps-devel mailing list
on SourceForge.

Ultimately, the cube was replaced by a model of a laptop, written by
Patrick "Petschge" Kilian (petschge@web.de) around 2005. During that
time, Robert Love (rml@novell.com) served as the project's maintainer
and was responsible for other code cleanups and improvements.
